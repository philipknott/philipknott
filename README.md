# Hey!

My name is Philip, and I'm an engineering student at the University of Colorado Boulder. This spring ('23), I will be graduating with a B.S. in Computer Science with honors. 

I'm experienced with frontend development and UI/UX design, but am also interested in backend development, machine learning, and graphic art/design.
